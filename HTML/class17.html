    <h1>3Rd Day of Car Learning</h1>
    <p> i was sitting from viskarma Chowk
        i just start to drive the car from office to take right turn 
        start with 1st Gear (press clutch)
        left the clutch slowly 
        speed 25 kmps ,Gear no 2nd.
        if speed is slow press clutch and go for 1st gear.
        handle should not hold tight .
        horn can be blown from both thumbs.
        left deeper - press up
        right deeper - press down.

    </p>
