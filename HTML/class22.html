    when i stated to take right turn 
    after 1st gear, i have appled 2nd gaer very ealry
    mistake happen without race slow down.
    1st gear only to take a start
    2nd gear up to 25 speed
    3rd gear up to 40 speed.
    if there is space you can go for 4th gear. otherwise 3rd or 2nd gear is good
    if you want to take turn left or right, apply indiator left (down) or right(upward).
    apply brake with care.
    apply clutch when speed is decreaking.
    handle should be free.
